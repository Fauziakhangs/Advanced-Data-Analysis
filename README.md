 Leveraging Data Analysis  Techniques To Improve Breast Cancer Diagnosis.

This project leverages the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset ðŸ§« to improve early detection of breast cancer through advanced data analysis. Using techniques like PCA ðŸ“Š, CFA, CCA, and Ridge Regression ðŸ“ˆ, identified key tumor featuresâ€”such as radius, perimeter, concavity, and fractal dimensionâ€”that help distinguish between malignant and benign cases. The ridge regression model achieved an impressive 97.25% accuracy âœ…. Visual tools like Helio plots ðŸŒ€ were used to interpret variable relationships. Overall, this project demonstrates how statistical methods can enhance breast cancer diagnostics and support more accurate, early-stage detection strategies ðŸŽ¯.
